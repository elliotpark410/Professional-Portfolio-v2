* Bootstrap CSS has pre-built cards with CSS styling that you can grab from their website


```

var fiveDayForecastCard = $(`
    <div class="pl-3">
        <div class="card pl-3 pt-3 mb-3 bg-primary text-light" style="width: 12rem;>
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5>${dateFiveDayForecast}</h5>
